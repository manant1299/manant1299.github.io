<p>Propagation is about Cuttings, growing plants form seeds and more thing about plants.
</p>

<p>Plant propagation is process of growing new plants form different sources.
</p>

<h4>Growing plants from seeds</h4>

<p>Growing plants from seed uses sexual reproduction because both male and female parts of the flower interact to form a seed. This seed is genetically unique.
</p>

<p>How to grow plants from seeds.
</p>

<li>1. Choose a container that is suitable most be big enough for the roots to grow and have holes to drain.</li>
<li>2. Make sure the container washed and sterilise.</li>
<li>3. Make sure that the seed is fresh check if it needs special conditions.</li>
<li>4. Fill the container with seed mix.</li>
<li>5. Level the mix to the rim of the container.</li>
<li>6. Pack closely the mix gently using something to flatten it.</li>
<li>7. Check the packed to see how depth and how spread parted.</li>
<li>8. Lightly water the seed.</li>
<li>9. Label the plants with what they are.</li>
<li>10. Put the container in a warm place.</li>

<h4>Cutting</h4>

<p>Cutting are parts of a plant that have been cut off.
</p>

<p>What are cuttings
</p>

<p>We can produce new plant by doing cutting which is asexual propagation. You can do the cutting in different places of the plant like stems.
 Also we need to know what season it is to cut it in the correct spot so it can grow its roots again so the cutting can survive.
 Also you need to know the type of plant so when the time comes you know what you are doing.
</p>

<p>There different type of cuttings like softwood cuttings, hardwood cuttings and Semi-hardwood cuttings and they all have to be done in
	 different time.
</p>

<p>How to grow softwood cuttings
</p>

<li>1. Make a cutting at a 45° angle just below the node</li>
<li>2. Make the length of the stem 7 cm to 15 cm</li>
<li>3. Wounded the bottom bit for the roots to grow</li>
<li>4. Put growth hormone on the wounded part at the bottom or not the growth hormone jus get the roots faster</li>
<li>5. Put the cutting into the ground or pot with soil</li>

<p>Make a softwood cutting at a 45° angle just below the node where cambium cells are very active. A high concentration of growth
 hormone gather together when the cambium is wounded. The length of stem cut should be 7 cm to 15 cm.
